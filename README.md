# ParqueDosHorrores
"Parque dos Horrores" is a student adventure game inspired by other games like Zelda, using an isometric perspective camera and shooting/item collecting mechanics.

- It was completely developed using Unity Game Engine, Playground scripts and my own scripts.

- Inside Unity, you can press Ctrl + O and open the scene "MenuScene.unity" under "ParqueDosHorrores\New Clown\Assets\Playground\Scenes" to start the game.

You can fully modify the project if you want, it would be great to see other people adding ideas to the game.
